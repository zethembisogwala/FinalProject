            <p>Computer Security is a method of using defense protocals to protect computer systems and networks. When an unauthorized person tries to get into a computer system – “computer security” is used in detecting that person and preventing that person from getting acces to it.  In order to be safe in todays world computer security is very essential. The main objective is to protect companies important &amp; private data from theft.</p>

There are three layers in the computer security:<ul>

<li>Hacking
An unauthorized person uses the computer is known as hacking. Cyber crimes main components include hacking.</li>

<li>Cracking
When the intention of the unauthorized person is of causing harm and creating problem than such a unauthorized intrusion is known as cracking.</li>

<li>Phreaking
Cracking of the phone network by unauthorized person it is known as phreaking.</li>
        </ul>

<p>Measures taken for the improvement in computer security are:
    <ul>
<li>The unauthorized persons who would potentially compromise security not be allowed to access computer systems.</li>
<li>Dependence on computer programs for computer security is prohibited and hence necessity for development of hardware mechanism.</li>
<li>Operating system mechanism development is also necessary for imposing the rules on programs.</li>
<li>Planning for programming strategies is also very important.</li></ul>

There are many ways for doing this. Here are various ways:<ul>
<li>One of the most common ways of computer security is using firewall. It can be setup to let only authenticated data flow in or out of the network.</li>
<li>Keeping the security &amp; virus protection sotware updated is very important</li>
<li>Passwords used should contain a mixture of alphabet, numeric values, and symbols. Passwords should also be changed on a regular basis.</li>
<li>Antivirus should be present and running at all times.</li>
<li>Encryption is very necessary as it secures data to a maximum extent.</li></ul>


Computer securities have some technical areas which are:<ul>
<li>Confidentiality</li>
<li>Integrity</li>
  <li>Authentication</li></ul>
<p>        
Confidentiality here means keeping things private or in secrecy so that unauthorized person cannot use it then comes integrity which means changes cannot be made by any unauthorized user as it is protected and last authentication means the person who is authorized for that that.</p>

<p>Computer security professionals are concerned mainly about  access control and nonrepudiation.</p>

<p>Access control means not only that user can access the resource and services but user has access to the resources which he legitimately expects.</p>

<p>Nonrepudiation means if a person sends a message then he cannot deny that he has sent it and vice versa.</p>
